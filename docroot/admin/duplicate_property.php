Built about 1685, Pentland House is the oldest surviving domestic building in the Borough. It was owned by the Smith family from the 1690s until 1856. Now much altered and extended, it is a stunning hall of residence offered numerous rooms available to let. It sits proudly on Old Road, in the heart of Lee, where a number of large similar country houses were built here in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p><p><strong>Whats on offer:</strong><br/>This beautiful, expansive property provides numerous living quarters to please all. Should you choose to lay your hat here, the single rooms are all generous in size and are offered fully furnished. The kitchen and bathroom facilities are shared, there are 6 shower rooms and 4 kitchens to each floor - queueing should not be a problem! Do your washing in the coin operated laundry room (located on the ground floor) or socialise in the large and accommodating common area; it&#039;s kitted out with plenty of chairs and a t.v for late night movies. </p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br/>There is an on-site 24hr concierge for peace of mind, and fire doors and exits are in place. There is a cleaner for all shared rooms three times a week but we&#039;re afraid you&#039;ll have to keep your own rooms tidy! The kitchens are kitted out with fridge/freezers, microwaves and cookers and there are also dining areas with a large table and chairs. The communal gardens are mature and extensive - great for barbeque&#039;s and sunbathing in the summer. The room has a broadband internet line, television point. and fitted wardrobe space.</p><p>All bills are included in the rent quoted.</p><p><strong>This share would suit:</strong><br/>A vibrant, friendly individual. You will have the opportunity to socialise with residents in the shared areas. All you need is one month&#039;s deposit, one month&#039;s rent and 3 references (work/college/personal) and you&#039;re in - don&#039;t hang about!</p><p><strong>Out and about:</strong></p><p>Old Road puts you within easy reach of Lee High Road and Lewisham shops and restaurants. Or saunter down to Blackheath Village for a less prosaic experience. Blackheath itself is a lovely open space, great for kite-flying (!) or for walking the dog. Also very close by is Manor House gardens (with tennis courts). Blackheath station, a 12 minute walk, has services direct into London Bridge. </p>', 'Single Room to Let in Enchanting Country Manor - Fully Furnished', 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, NULL, '', '3865_17047267314638795e06de5.jpg', '3865_907401416463879b7cdd65.jpg', '3865_13630414463879eba4db1.jpg', '3865_14121549314638797725bac.jpg', '3865_1685350708463879772639b.jpg', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, '2007-05-02 12:42:22', NULL, '2007-05-03 12:50:12', 0, 539264, 175079, 30, NULL, 'No', 3, NULL, 2, 2, '', '', '', '', 'Communal', 'None', 'Not Created', '', '', 'TBC', '2007-05-02 00:00:00');
