<p>The first rule of printing is Print in Black and White</p>
<p>The second rule of printing is Print in Black and White!!</p>
<p>Please always print black and white as it is 10 times cheaper than printing 
  in colour. Even a tiny speck of colour will count as a colour print, so always 
  follow the instructions below..</p>
<p>Click File
  Click Print
  The selected printer should already be &#8220;Fiery EX12 Color Server PS 2.0&#8221;
  Click Properties or Preferences, the following screen will appear:</p>
<p><img src="printpref.gif" width="610" height="469"></p>
<p>
  If it isn&#8217;t already selected, click the Fiery Printing tab.
  Click on the Saved Settings drop-down menu and choose your desired print mode. 
  The available modes are:</p>
<p>Normal This will print on plain white paper
  Headed This will print on Wooster &amp; Stock headed paper</p>
<p>It may ask you if you want to save changes to &#8220;Untitled&#8221;, click 
  No.</p>
<p>You can also select the number of copies you wish to print. 
  Click OK
  This will take you back to the Print dialogue box
  Click Print or OK</p>
<p>When you click print the document is sent to the print queue. If there are 
  other jobs in the queue yours will join the end of that queue. You will hear 
  3 beeps when the print job completes successfully.</p>
<p>If you hear 4 long loud beeps it means a problem has occurred. You need to 
  go to the printer and look on the screen; it will tell you the problem and how 
  to solve it. Usually this will be out of paper, or paper jam.</p>
<p>If your document does not print:</p>
<p>1. DO NOT click print again. 
  You will just send both jobs to the queue and you will end up printing your 
  document twice, thus wasting paper and ink.</p>
<p>2. Check the printer for errors. 
  Look on the screen of the printer for any messages, and on the screen on the 
  RIP (the computer next to the printer). It may be out of paper, have a paper 
  jam or be low on toner. The screen will instruct you how to solve the problem, 
  but if in any doubt please ask the IT department.</p>
<p>3. See if there is a big print job being formatted.
  You can tell by looking on the screen of the RIP if there is a print job being 
  formatted. This could be someone printing property cards; it takes much longer 
  than a normal document.</p>
<p>If the machine says it is out of toner do not try and change it, please inform 
  the IT department immediately.</p>

  machine. Slide it to your left until the green light illuminates.</p>
<p>Heavy Weight paper:
  Lift the top cover of the printer and place your document face down on the glass. 
  Align the paper to the top left of the glass. Take care not to touch the glass 
  with your greasy mits!</p>
<p>On the screen you can select various options:
  In general you should select Black, Paper Tray 1</p>
<p>Enter the number of copies you want on the keypad and click the green button
