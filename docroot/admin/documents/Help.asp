<p><b>Q: What do I do if the printer is spurting out pages of rubbish? (EPSON 
  PRINTERS ONLY)</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Turn off the printer. Restart the computer to which the printer is 
  connected (click start, shut down, and restart). Once the computer has restarted 
  you should send the file or document to print again. If the printer is on the 
  top floor it is connected to Jenny's and on the bottom floor is connected to 
  Simon's.</p>

<p><b>Q: What do I do if my machine won't print? (EPSON PRINTERS ONLY)</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>This is usually down a problem with the computer to which the printer 
  is connected (Jenny's or Simon's). Click start and click printers. Open the 
  Epson Stylus Colour 900 icon. This will list all pending print jobs. You can 
  select and delete each of these jobs one by one to clear the queue. If this 
  fails, restart the computer and send the file or document to print again.</p>

<p><b>Q: What do do if my computer has crashed?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Fatal Exception Errors, General Protection Faults, any other form 
  of &quot;Blue Screen&quot; error message or general system freezes are always 
  solved by restarting the computer. If you cannot shut the computer down in the 
  normal way, press in and hold the power button on the base unit for 5 seconds 
  until it turns off. Wait a minute and press it again to restart the machine.</p>
